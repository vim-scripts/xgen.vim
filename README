" Overview
" --------
"
" xgen.vim generates a menu for GENeration Xml-Element templates
" for different W3C-Recommondations.
"
" In addition to generation you can browse through the
" recommendation structure and have some simple but useful commands.
"
" You can find the following recommondations in the xGen-menu
" if they are enabled. Each one can be enable and disabled in
" this menu. If all an enable, the performance might be influenced.
" 
" dtd:  Document Type Definitions for XML 1.0
"
" fo:   Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) Version 1.0
"       Recommendation 15 October 2001
"
" html: Extensible HTML version 1.0 Strict DTD
"
" svg:  SVG 1.0 2001 September 04
"
" xsd : XML Schema 
"       Recommendation, 2 May 2001 
"

" XML-menu structure
" --------------
"
" TEMPLATES  : to generate some of my favourite templates
" MIN        : to generate the element with all required attributes
" MAX        : to generate the element with all attributes
" ------------
" ROOTS      : shows all root-elements and generates them, including
"              the <?xml ... and the xmlns
" BROWSE     : shows all possible child element for all elements,
"              so you can analyse the structure
" ------------
" FILL       : after creation, the elements are empty with a 
"              closing />. Use FILL to splitt the element
" >>         : the creation in done in the next line. Often
"              it is useful to shift the new element to the right
" <<         : to correct a shift to the left
" AUTOINDENT : normaly generation is most efficient with autoindent
"
"
" DTD-menu structure
" ------------------
"
" For DTD, only MIN, AUTOINDENT, >> and << are suported.
"
" The MIN-Structure inside the dtd.MIN, can be used in a
" comparable way. The items sould be "self explaining". Some
" specials are:
" 
" ATTRIBUTE-FIXED    : CDATA FIXED
" ATTRIBUTE-IMPLIED  : CDATA IMPLIED
" ATTRIBUTE-REQUIRED : CDATA REQUIRED
" ATTRIBUTE-VALUE    : CDATA VALUE
" ATTRIBUTE-VALUE-*  : replaces " CDATA " in the for about cases
"
" DOCTYPE-EXTERNAL   : external SYSTEM DOCTYPE
" DOCTYPE-MIXED      : mixed SYSTEM DOCTYPE
" DOCTYPE-PUBLIC     : replaces " SYSTEM " to PUBLIC in the two
"                      above cases
"
